        I most prefer a drip coffee with oat milk. Sometimes, I like to add 3 raw sugars to a 12 ounce cup if I'm wanting a sweet treat. Ethiopian blends are my favorite for their high caffeine content and their bright, fruity, and floral notes. Medium and dark roast coffees have a bold flavor that's too bold for my liking.
